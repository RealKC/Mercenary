,
numbers: normal base 10 numbers, like `123`, `0912`, etc. Other bases aren't required.
variable names: normal variables, ie starts with any letter or `_`, followed by any amount of letters, numbers, or `_`
strings: both double and single quoted strings act the same. Start from a `'` or `"`, and go until the same quote is seen. There's A few escape sequences I want:
	\': a `'` character
	\": a `"` character
	\\: a `\` character
	\n: a newline character
	\t: a tab character
	\r: a carriage return character
	\f: a form feed character
	\x##: a character with the hex code `##`.
	(These are all the same as they are in C++)
